This document summarizes the work I have done in the past year for the DOE report, starting with DUNE and followed by NO$\nu$A.

\section{DUNE}

\subsection{Comparison of Photon Detector Designs at CDDF}
We compared the performance of the photon detector designs from CSU and LSU. Detectors were put side by side in the Dewar at CDDF. Each detector has 2 SiPM channels. Figure~\ref{fig:cddfadc} shows the integrated ADC for the four SiPM channels. A threshold scan was done to set the threshold just above the pedestal peak. The detectors were irradiated by an $\alpha$ source and triggered at 0.5 photoelectron for each channel independently.

\end{figure}

  \caption{Average light yield for at least 2 PEs for the four channels.}
  \label{fig:cddfly}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cddfcalibrated} shows calibrated photoelectron (PE) spectra for the four channels. The calibration was done by assigning the first peak to 1 PE, the second to 2 PE, etc.

Since the data showed a high trigger rate, the light yields were compared by excluding the single PE events. Figure~\ref{fig:cddfly} shows the average number of photoelectrons of events with at least 2 PEs. This figure shows the four channels have comparable light yield in this $\ge 2$ PE measure.

\subsection{Monitor Application for Voltage Readback of the SiPM Signal Processor}

CSU owns 2 SiPM Signal Processors (SSP). The SSP supplies high voltage to its 12 independent channels, and for each channel a readback register is in place for monitoring voltage in operation. A monitor application is developed to serve this purpose.

\subsection{Control Application for the LBNE Calibration Module}

This module is named after the former name of the experiment, LBNE. The LBNE Calibration Module (LCM) outputs calibration signals to 3 different calibration subsystem, namely, the Indiana University (IU) system, the TPC system, and the photon detector (PD) system. Figure~\ref{fig:pulser_pulse} shows sample pulses generated by the control application for the LCM. To facilitate the use of the control application, a simple GUI frontend is also provided as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pulser_frontend}.

\section[NOvA]{NO$\nu$A}

\subsection{Generation of Flat Monte Carlo Neutrino Spectrum}

The neutrino flux of the NuMI beam peaks at 2 GeV. The total interaction cross-section of neutrino is roughly $\sim E$, which at high energy is dominated by the deep inelastic scattering. The left plot in Figure~\ref{fig:NuMISpec} shows the total neutrino flux of the NuMI beam (the black histogram) from simulation. The right plot in Figure~\ref{fig:NuMISpec} is the neutrino event spectrum. The event spectrum is highly peaked around 2 GeV, leading to lack of statistics for particle identification (PID) training with neural network algorithms outside the peak range. There is need to warp the input neutrino flux to have a flat neutrino event spectrum for the PID training of the off-peak events. The idea is to make the input flux $\sim1/E$. Figure~\ref{fig:inverseEflux} shows the $1/E$ warped flux. Figure~\ref{fig:flatspec} is a sample output of the neutrino event spectrum gone through GENIE simulation with a $1/E$ input flux, which has an evenly distributed number of events in the interested energy range.

  \caption{The neutrino event spectrum with a $1/E$ input flux.}

\end{figure}

\subsection[Numu on e Event Topology]{$\nu_\mu$ on e event topology}

$\nu_\mu-e$ scattering is one of the simplest processes whose cross-section can be calculated very accurately. Therefore these events can be used for constraining the NuMI flux. The characteristic feature of the $\nu_\mu-e$ events leaving in the detector is a 1-prong electromagnetic shower in the very forward direction.  We used the near detector MC data to check how well our current reconstruction algorithms work for $\nu_\mu-e$ scattering events. A sample event where the current reconstruction algorithms reconstruct successfully as a 1-prong event is given in Figure~\ref{fig:oneprong}. However there are also events in which the number of the reconstructed prongs is more than one, such as that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:multiprong}. This is because current algorithms pull the vertex downstream into the shower, leaving 2 back-to-back prongs. The proportion of events for which current algorithms perform well is about $70\%$, while the proportion of the incorrectly reconstructed events is about $30\%$, leaving room for improvements.

  \caption{A $\nu_\mu$ on $e$ event where the current reconstruction algorithms reconstruct incorrectly as a multi-prong event. The hollow cross indicates the reconstructed vertex where the interaction happens. Current algorithms pull the vertex downstream into the shower, leaving 2 back-to-back prongs.}
